# theArtOfComputerProgramming, By Donal E. Knuth


My exercises on Donald E. Knuth's masterpiece.

By no means is this planned as a repository to copy and distribute the authors book. This is only meant for my own tracking of progress working through his books. I am starting this as of 02/27/2021. The goal is to work on this over the weekends while I use Mon - Fri for my bootcamp work.
