# Thoughts on my solution

- This took longer than expected because I wanted to create it in a functional way, which I managed to fail miserably. I know it's possible but my brain is just not wrapping itself around that concept, and/or I need more knowledge of how to do it properly.
- The second pitfall I had with this one is I tried to create an if else statement for the division itself instead of using do...while loop. Once i switched to the do...while loop the solution was instant.

# Refactoring
- This algorithm can be improved in many ways
1. The function needs to be separated into smaller chunks
2. There is probably a better way for the looping apart from the do..while looping.

- for now this will work, but I am not satisfied how long it took and how difficult it was for me to write it in a functional way. I will refactor this code in the future.
