# Structure
- Chapter01 has 4 major sections
- the first major section is small therefore there are no subsections
- sections 2, 3 and 4 will probably contain subsection folders.
## The sections:
1. Algorithms
2. Mathematical Preliminaries
3. MIX
4. Some Fundamental Programming Techniques
- This repo will be growing and I might change the setup down the line. It is evolving with my knowledge and skills.
