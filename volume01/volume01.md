# Volume 01
# Fundamental Algorithms, Third Edition

Volume 1 focuses on the basics, the concepts and techniques used in programming.
Looking at the contents page the amount of theory and tests are distributed on 450 plus pages. After the theory there are answers to the exercises. My goal is to give every exercise a solid attempt at solving it myself, but I do believe there will de ones that are too difficult to complete. I do hope I will be able to understand the explanations.

Knuth uses a pseudo-code language he developed himself, called MIX. I am versed in Ruby and JavaScript. I will try to solve the problems in JavaScript first due to the intensive focus I want to give it.
